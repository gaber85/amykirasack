_it me_

## just what is this? 🤔

My personal portfolio website + blog built with Gatsby & Typescript. Now with 100% more _parallax scroll_ effects and snazzy animations that no one asked for, yet here we are. Responsive for mobile through 4k displays. 🤞

Also home to some of my writing side projects for your reading pleasure. 📖
